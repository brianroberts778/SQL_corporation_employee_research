# SQL_corporation_employee_research
It is a beautiful spring day, and it is two weeks since you have been hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard. Your first major task is a research project on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remain of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files.
In this assignment, you will design the tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data. In other words, you will perform: Data Engineering & Data Analysis

Data Modeling: Inspected the CSVs and sketched a ERD of the tables.

Data Engineering: Created a table schema for each of the six CSVs; specifying data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.
Then imported each CSV file into their corresponding SQL table. 

Bonus Analysis: As you examine the data, you are overcome with a creeping suspicion that the dataset is fake. You surmise that your boss handed you spurious data in order to test the data engineering skills of a new employee. To confirm your hunch, you decide to take the following steps to generate a visualization of the data, with which you will confront your boss...
Imported the SQL database into Pandas. Created a histogram to visualize the most common salary ranges for employees. Created a bar chart of average salary by title.
